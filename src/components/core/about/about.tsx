                    Hey there! I'm Ellie Solhjou, a tech enthusiast with a passion for solving real-world problems through code and creativity. By day, I'm diving deep into computer science at USC, and by night, I'm crafting solutions that mix tech with a touch of sustainability. Whether I'm managing projects or developing software, I'm all about making an impact and having fun while doing it. Let's build something amazing togetherâ€”one line of code (and maybe a bit of coffee) at a time!
